<H1>    Program M3FAKE </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;outfile&gt;     &lt;path name&gt;
    m3fake
</PRE>
where <VAR>outfile</VAR> is the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> 
of the output file.  
<P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

The <CODE>M3FAKE</CODE> program prompts the user, one item at
a time, for the contents of a 
<A HREF = "INCLUDES.html#fdesc"> file description </A>
including starting date and time, time step and number of
steps, and for choice of formula to be used for the fill
values.  The program then builds a file according to these
specifications.  In order to describe the 
<A HREF = "GRIDS.html#horiz">horizontal coordinate system and
grid</A>, the user may either supply the name of the horizontal 
grid, as found in the <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html">GRIDDESC</A> 
file, or else may supply all parameters in a complete description 
of the grid and coordinate system, entry by entry.
<P> 

Currently, only the following <STRONG>file types</STRONG> are supported:
<UL>
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#custom"> CUSTOM</A>, 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#grdded"> GRIDDED</A>, and 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#bndary"> BOUNDARY</A>
</UL>                                                    
The following <STRONG>formulas</STRONG> are currently available,
on a per-variable basis:
<UL>
    <LI>  column number
    <LI>  row number
    <LI>  level number
    <LI>  time step number
    <LI>  user-specified fill value
    <LI>  <STRONG>data from a user-specified ASCII file</STRONG>.
          This file should be a list-directed (e.g., comma-delimited)
          ASCII file containing all of thedesired input data to be copied
          into the output file, ordered and formatted as follows:
          <UL>
              <LI>  The fastest subscript should be grid-column
              <LI>  There should be a line-break after each column
              <LI>  The next-fastest subscript should be grid-row
              <LI>  The third-fastest subscript should be grid-layer (if
                    the number of layers is more than 1)
              <LI>  The slowest subscript should be time-step, if the
                    file is time-stepped.
          </UL>
</UL>
<P> 

    <STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> you need to assign a 
    <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> to the physical file
    names of the output file, according to Models-3 conventions, using 
    the operation(s) 
    <PRE>
        setenv GRIDDESC  &lt;pathname&gt;
        setenv &lt;lname&gt;   &lt;pname&gt;
    </PRE>

    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical name
    you have chosen for the output file, and for its description.  The
    prompts  will have default responses whichcan be accepted by
    hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.   The specification ofstarting date and
    time, and duration for the file specification follow Models-3  <A
    HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time conventions. </A>
    <P> 

    Note that the set of specifications for which files can be
    constructed  by one execution of M3FAKE is quite complex, being
    dependent upon the  file type, variables and other structures in
    the file being constructed. If you want to run this program in
    <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG>  (i.e., from a script), the recommended
    way to develop the script is to  run the program once interactively
    while noting the pattern of responses  to prompts which generate
    the particular analysis you want.  The  pattern of responses then
    becomes either a command-output file which  is redirected into the
    program's execution by the script, or becomes  a
    &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution.
    <P> 

    <STRONG>Versions of the program</STRONG> are available for each
    <A HREF = "LIBS.html"> supported architecture </A> (workstation
    versions are currently in the directories  <VAR>/env/apps/(SunOS5 |
    IRIX5 | alphaOSF1)/bin</VAR>; Cray versions are in
