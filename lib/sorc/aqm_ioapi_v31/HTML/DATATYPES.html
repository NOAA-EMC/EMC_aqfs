<H1>    File and Data Types Supported by the I/O API </H1>

There are eight <A HREF = "#struct"> <STRONG>structure-types</STRONG> </A> 
for <A HREF = "VBLE.html"> variables </A> in files presently supported 
by the I/O API.The I/O API was designed so that this list of file types 
might be extended with relatively little effort.  The types are associated 
with file type <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#magic"> &quot;magic number&quot; 
parameter values </A> which are defined in INCLUDE-file 
<A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"> PARMS3.EXT </A>.  
The current set of file types, together with the names of the magic
number parameters, is given by the list below.  Note that declarations
are given in terms of <CODE>REAL*4</CODE> and <CODE>REAL*8</CODE>; this
will protect you if you do things like using precision-doubling software
or &quot;f77 -r8 ...&quot; compiler flags to force double precision
calculations in your code and linking the wrong version of the low-level
XDR data representation library by accident.  (If you don't do these things, 
using <CODE>REAL</CODE> in these declarations is quite all right.)  The 
list of file types, together with the magic numbers for each, is:
<UL>
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#custom"> <STRONG>CUSTOM3</STRONG>:  custom </A>, 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#dctnry"> <STRONG>DCTNRY3</STRONG>:  dictionary </A>, 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#grdded"> <STRONG>GRDDED3</STRONG>:  gridded </A>, 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#bndary"> <STRONG>BNDARY3</STRONG>:  boundary </A>, 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#iddata"> <STRONG>IDDATA3</STRONG>:  ID-referenced </A>, 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#profil"> <STRONG>PROFIL3</STRONG>:  vertical profile </A>, 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#grnest"> <STRONG>GRNEST3</STRONG>:  nested grid</A>, and 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#smatrx"> <STRONG>SMATRX3</STRONG>:  sparse matrix</A>, 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#kfevnt"> <STRONG>KFEVNT3</STRONG>:  cloud-event</A>
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#tsries"> <STRONG>TSRIES3</STRONG>:  (hydrology)
    time series </A>
    <LI>  <A HREF = "#ptrfly"> <STRONG>PTRFLY3</STRONG>:  pointer-flyer</A>
</UL>
The file's structural data type value is stored in the FTYPE3D variable 
of the file header and the file description data structures in 
<A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A>.  Note that
all the <A HREF = "VBLE.html"> variables </A> in a file have the 
same structural data type, the same dimensionality and 
<A HREF = "GRIDS.html#vert"> layer structure </A>, and 
the same <A HREF = "#timestruct"> time step structure </A>, but possibly 
a different <A HREF = "#basic"> basic type </A>.  
The vast majority of air quality modeling files are of the gridded or 
boundary structural types of basic type REAL, which need
only ordinary arrays to write from or read into.  For the other
types, you will have to set up COMMONs as described below, to match
the data structure for the variables in the file.
<P>

Independent of data structure-types, there are three categories of 
<A NAME = "basic"> <STRONG>basic</STRONG> or <STRONG>underlying 
types</STRONG> </A> which variables in the data records may have.
Note that each variable has a basic type of its own; it is quite 
legitimate to have a gridded file with 5 gridded integer variables,
3 gridded real variables, and 7 gridded double-precision variables.
The list of data types, together with the &quot;magic numbers&quot; 
(chosen to be consistent with existing netCDF magic numbers) 
for each (defined in INCLUDE-file
<A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"> PARMS3.EXT </A>) is the following:
<UL>
    <LI>  <STRONG>M3INT:</STRONG>  INTEGER (4-byte integer)
    <LI>  <STRONG>M3REAL:</STRONG>  REAL  (single-precision)
    <LI>  <STRONG>M3DBLE:</STRONG>  DOUBLE PRECISION (at least 8-byte)
</UL>
The basic-type magic-number values for all variables in a file are stored in 
the VTYPE3D arrays of the file header and the file description data 
structures in <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A>.
Currently, only real variables are supported by routines
<A HREF = "INTERP3.html"> INTERP3()</A> and
<A HREF = "DDTVAR3.html"> DDTVAR3()</A>, and analysis programs
<A HREF = "M3STAT.html"> M3STAT()</A> and
<A HREF = "M3DIFF.html"> M3DIFF()</A>; only integer and real
variables are supported for <A HREF = "BUFFERED.html"> buffered 
virtual files </A>.<P> 

Independent of data structure-types, there are also three categories of 
<A NAME = "timestruct"> <STRONG>time structure</STRONG> </A>
for the data records, discriminated on the basis of the TSTEP3D attribute,
and further specified by the starting date and time SDATE3D and STIME3D
attributes in the file header and <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC </A> 
data structures.  Time step and starting date and time are stored 
according to <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> Models-3 time conventions </A>.
Internally, the I/O API maintains the value of MXREC3D, the maximum
time step record number, which describes &quot;how long&quot; the file
is.  The categories of time step structure are:
<UL>
    <LI> <STRONG>Time-independent.</STRONG>  TSTEP3D = 0, and SDATE3D and
         STIME3D are ignored.  MXREC3D is either 0 (for an empty file)
         or 1.
    <LI> <STRONG>Time-stepped.</STRONG> TSTEP3D &gt; 0, and SDATE3D:STIME3D
         represent the starting date&time for the file's time step sequence.
         There are at most MXREC3D time steps in that sequence.
    <LI> <STRONG>Circular-buffer.</STRONG> TSTEP3D &lt; 0 is the negative
         of the actual time step; the file keeps only two time steps of
         data, the &quot;even&quot; part and the &quot;odd&quot; part.
         SDATE3D:STIME3D represent the starting date&time for the file's 
         time step sequence.  There are at most MXREC3D time steps in that
         sequence.
</UL><P> 

Each of these data types supports multiple 
<A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> time steps </A> of multiple 
<A HREF = "GRIDS.html#vert"> layers </A> of 
multiple user-defined <A HREF = "VBLE.html"> variables </A>, as 
indicated below (a time step of a variable being all of the data
values associated with the date and time of that time step.)

In some cases, there are additional system-defined variables which are
part of the data structure (e.g., the 
<A HREF = "#iddata"> NUMIDS in the ID-referenced-data data structure,  </A>
below).  Where such system-defined variables are present, 
the operations <A HREF = "READ3.html"> READ3() </A> 
and <A HREF = "WRITE3.html"> WRITE3() </A> act on entire 
time steps -- i.e., of all variables -- at once; otherwise, they can 
be used to store or retrieve time steps of individual variables one at 
a time.  There are moderate performance advantages to writing the 
variables for a time step in the same order that they appear in the 
file description, and for writing the time steps in consecutive order; 
however, this is not required by the I/O API (which permits any access 
order to the data, for both read and write operations).
<P> 


<H2> <A NAME = "custom"> <STRONG>CUSTOM3</STRONG> </A> = -1:   </H2>

    custom data--this is just a user-dimensioned array of
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#basic"> REAL, INTEGER, or 
    DOUBLE PRECISION </A> that the system reads and writes reliably; it's 
    up to you to interpret its structure for yourself.  (This type
    was included on the &quot;I probably haven't thought of everything&quot; 
    principle.)  A typical argument declaration for a set of variables 
    to be used with a CUSTOM file would look like the following, where 
    the dimensioning constant  <CODE>SIZE</CODE> maps into the 
    <PRE>NCOLS3D</PRE> <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> file description </A> 
    parameter; <CODE>NROWS3D</CODE> and <CODE>NTHIK3D</CODE> are ignored):
<PRE>
    ...(SIZE is a fixed, user-defined dimension:)
    REAL*4  ARRAY( SIZE, NLAYS, NVARS )
</PRE>

    
<H2> <A NAME = "dctnry"> <STRONG>DCTNRY3</STRONG> </A> = 0: </H2>

    dictionary--the reusable parts of a file description; 
    this data type is used to store and retrieve the following parts of an
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A> file description:
<PRE>
    FTYPE3D, TSTEP3D, NCOLS3D, NROWS3D, NLAYS3D, NVARS3D, NTHIK3D,
    GDTYP3D, P_ALP3D, P_BET3D, P_GAM3D, XORIG3D, YORIG3D, XCELL3D, 
    YCELL3D, GDNAM3D, XCENT3D, YCENT3D, VNAME3D, UNITS3D, VDESC3D
</PRE>

    Note that all of these dimensioning and descriptive attributes are,
    of course, themselves not applicable to the DCTNRY3 file, and that
    the data structures for storage and retrieval are already defined
    for you in <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A>.
    
    Dictionary files can be used to make much easier the process of
    file creation within a particular model.  To do this, you would
    begin by standardizing on names for file structure templates, and
    then build a dictionary file which contains these templates.  A
    modeler needing to create or open a file with template name
    &quot;FOO&quot;  and logical name &quot;MY_FOO&quot; using the 
    dictionary with logical name &quot;D&quot; would then do the 
    following (using the dictionary file, routines 
    <A HREF = "READ3.html"> READ3() </A> to get the 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT file description </A> and 
    <A HREF = "OPEN3.html"> OPEN3() </A> to create or open the
    file using it):
    <PRE>
    ...
C........ Assume that dictionary file D has been opened.  
C........ Use READ3() on this dictionary file to put the 
C........ standard parts of a file description into
C........ the FDESC3 data structures:
    
    IF ( .NOT. READ3( 'D', 'FOO', 0, 0, 0, 0 ) ) THEN
        CALL M3ERR( 'my routine', 0, 0,
 &amp;      'Could not read file template FOO from dictionary D',
 &amp;      .TRUE. ) 
    END IF
    
C........ Now put the timestep, starting date, and starting time 
C........into the file description
    
    SDATE3D = JDATE
    STIME3D = JTIME
    TSTEP3D = TSTEP
    
C........ Call OPEN3 to open FOO (in this case as an UNKNOWN -- 
C........ create if necessary; otherwise perform consistency check):
    
    IF ( .NOT. OPEN3( 'MY_FOO', FSUNKN3, 'my routine' ) ) THEN
        CALL M3ERR( 'my routine', JDATE, JTIME,
 &amp;      'Could not open/create file MY_FOO',
 &amp;      .TRUE. ) 
    END IF
    ...
    </PRE>

    Dictionary files <EM>support</EM> model management policies having
    standardized file templates, but do not <EM>mandate</EM> them
    (since one can fill in an entire file description in-line before 
    calling OPEN3() to create non-standard files).  This gives
    opportunities both for rigor and accountability and for
    flexibility.  An interesting application of the flexibility and
    power thus afforded is that of  multiple-grid situations such as 
    you find with two-way  nesting, where it is perfectly reasonable 
    to have one dictionary per  grid (say &quot;D_GRID1&quot; , 
    &quot;D_GRID2&quot; , ..., with  all the dictionaries sharing a 
    common set of names for the  templates they contain.  Programs can 
    then fetch file  descriptions (say for the grid-<VAR>n</VAR> template 
    &quot;FOO&quot;) as 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    &quot;READ3( 'D_GRID<VAR>n</VAR>', 'FOO', ... &quot;
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    
<H2> <A NAME = "grdded"> <STRONG>GRDDED3</STRONG> </A> = 1:   </H2>

    gridded data, dimensioned as in:
<PRE>
    REAL*4  ARRAY( NCOLS, NROWS, NLAYS, NVARS )
</PRE>

    Note that <CODE>NTHIK3D</CODE> is ignored.


<H2> <A NAME = "bndary"> <STRONG>BNDARY3</STRONG> </A> = 2:   </H2>

    boundary data for an external perimeter to a grid.  
    This perimeter is <CODE>NTHIK</CODE> cells wide (where you may use a 
    negative <CODE>NTHIK</CODE> to indicate an internal perimeter such as 
    is used by ROM and RADM).  The boundary array is dimensioned 
    as follows in terms of the dimensions for the array it surrounds:
<PRE>
    ...(SIZE = ABS( NTHIK )*(2*NCOLS + 2*NROWS +4*NTHIK)
    REAL*4  ARRAY( SIZE, NLAYS, NVARS )
</PRE>
    There are accompanying diagrams illustrating the data layout for
    various cases of NTHIK:
    <UL>
        <LI> the general thickened-boundary case, NTHIK &gt; 1, available 
            as <A HREF = "THKBDY.ps"> Postscript</A>,

            as <A HREF = "THKBDY.gif"> GIF</A>;
        <LI> the simple case, NTHIK = 1, available 
            as <A HREF = "BDY.ps"> Postscript </A>,

    </UL>
   
<H2> <A NAME = "iddata"> <STRONG>IDDATA3</STRONG> </A> = 3:   </H2>

    ID-referenced data, used to store lists of data  like surface 
    meteorology observations, pollution-monitor observations, or
    county-averaged concentrations.  (ROM people note:  this is a
    generalization of ROM Type 2 and 3 files, except that if you want 
    the positions and elevations, you have to list them as variables 
    yourself.)  An example of observational data with up to 100 sites, 
    each measuring temperature, pressure, and relative humidity is the 
    following:
<PRE>
    ...
    INTEGER*4   MAXID              !  max permitted # of sites
    PARAMETER ( MAXID = 100 )
    ...
    INTEGER*4   NUMIDS             !  number of actual sites
    INTEGER*4   IDLIST( MAXID )    !  list of site ID's
    REAL*4      XLON  ( MAXID )    !  first variable in file
    REAL*4      YLAT  ( MAXID )    !  second variable
    REAL*4      TK    ( MAXID )    !  third variable
    REAL*4      PRES  ( MAXID )    !  fourth variable
    REAL*4      RH    ( MAXID )    !  fifth (last) variable
    COMMON /FOO/ NUMIDS, IDLIST, XLON, YLAT, TK, PRES, RH
</PRE>
    
    The dimension <CODE>MAXID</CODE> maps into the <CODE>NROWS3D</CODE> 
    dimension in the file description data structure 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A>, for use 
    by <A HREF = "OPEN3.html"> OPEN3() </A> or 
    <A HREF = "DESC3.html"> DESC3() </A>.  <CODE>NCOLS3D</CODE> and 
    <CODE>NTHIK3D</CODE> are ignored.  To read or write  this data, 
    put the first element,  <CODE>NUMIDS,</CODE> of this common in 
    the &quot;array&quot; argument spot of 
    <A HREF = "READ3.html"> READ3() </A> or
    <A HREF = "WRITE3.html"> WRITE3() </A>:
<PRE>
    IF ( .NOT. WRITE3( 'myfile', 'ALL', JDATE, JTIME, NUMIDS ) ) THEN
    ...(some kind of error happened--deal with it here)
    END IF
</PRE>


<H2> <A NAME = "profil"> <STRONG>PROFIL3</STRONG> </A> = 4:   </H2>

    vertical profile data (rawindsonde data), which 
    has a sufficiently different structure from other observational data
    (having possibly a site-dependent number of levels at each site)
    that it deserves a special data type of its own.  (This is a
    generalization of ROM Type 1 files.)  An example of the  sort of 
    data structure needed for a rawinsonde file with variables ELEV, 
    TA, and QV given at up to 50 stations, each of which may have up 
    to 100 observation levels,  is given by the following.  Note that 
    in this case, ELEV = &quot;height of the level above ground&quot;
    is user-specified  as one of the variables.
<PRE>
    ...
    INTEGER     MXIDP             !  max # of sites
    INTEGER     MXLVL             !  max # of levels

</PRE>
    
    The site dimension <CODE>MXIDP</CODE> maps into the

<H2> <A NAME = "grnest"> <STRONG>GRNEST3</STRONG> </A> = 5:   </H2>

    nested-grid data should be considered as a 
    preliminary and experimental implementation for storing multiple 
    grids, which need not in fact have any particular relationship 
    with each other beyond using the same coordinate system.  An 
    example of the  sort of data structure needed for a nest of grids 
    for variables NO2 and O3 is the following:
<PRE>
    ...
    INTEGER*4   MXNEST            !  max # of nests
    INTEGER*4   MXGRID            !  max # of cells (total, all grids)
    INTEGER*4   MXLAYS            !  max # of levels
    PARAMETER ( MXNEST = 10, MXGRID = 10000, MXLAYS = 25 )

</PRE>
        
    The nest dimension <CODE>MXNEST</CODE> maps into the 
    <CODE>NROWS3D</CODE> dimension, the cells  dimension 
    <CODE>MXGRID</CODE> maps onto <CODE>NCOLS3D,</CODE> and the 
    layers dimension  <CODE>MXLAYS</CODE> maps onto <CODE>NLAYS3D</CODE> 
    in the file description 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A> data structures.   
    <CODE>NTHIK3D</CODE> is ignored.  To read or write this data, put

    END IF
</PRE>


<H2> <A NAME = "smatrx"> <STRONG>SMATRX3</STRONG> </A> = 6:   </H2>

    sparse matrix data, which uses a &quot;skyline-transpose&quot;
    representation for sparse matrices, such as those found in the
    emissions model prototype.  An example of the sort of data
    structure needed for these sparse matrices is the following:
<PRE>
    ...
    INTEGER     NMATX   !  number of coefficients in the matrix
    INTEGER     NROWS   !  number of rows in the matrix
    PARAMETER ( NMATX = 233100, NGRID = 5400 )
    ...
    INTEGER     NS( NROWS ) !  # of actual cols per row
    INTEGER     IS( NMATX ) !  column pointers
    REAL        CS( NMATX ) !  col-coefficients
            
    COMMON  / GRIDMAT / NS, IS, CS
</PRE>

    The coefficients dimension <CODE>NMATX</CODE> maps into the 
    <CODE>NCOLS3D</CODE> dimension and the matrix-rows dimension 
    <CODE>NROWS</CODE> maps into the <CODE>NROWS3D</CODE> dimension
    in the file description <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> 
    FDESC3.EXT </A> data structures.  <CODE>NTHIK3D</CODE> is the 
    number of (actual) columns in the original (full, not sparse)

<H2> <A NAME = "kfevnt"> <STRONG>KFEVNT3</STRONG> </A> = -3:  Cloud-event </H2>

    KF-Cloud files and their operations may be considered
    &quot;friends&quot; of the I/O API.  KF-Cloud files use the same
    file description data structures (from FDESC3.EXT) and defining
    parameters (from PARMS3.EXT); the usual I/O API 
    <A HREF = "DESC3.html">DESC3()</A> call may
    be used to retrieve file descriptions from the headers.  KF-Cloud
    file, on the other hand, have their own specialized opening/creation, 
    lookup/indexing, input, and output operations 
    <CODE><A HREF="KFOPEN.html">KFOPEN()</A></CODE>,
    <CODE><A HREF="KFINDX.html">KFINDX()</A></CODE>,
    <CODE><A HREF="KFREAD.html">KFREAD()</A></CODE>, and
    <CODE><A HREF="KFWRITE.html">KFWRITE()</A></CODE>.  In addition
    they may be opened by the usual opening/creation operation
    <CODE><A HREF="OPEN3.html">OPEN3()</A></CODE>.
    <P> 

    KF-Cloud files have three components:
    <UL>
        <LI>  a <A HREF = "#hdr"><STRONG>file header</STRONG></A> 
              which matches the I/O API file header structure; 
        <LI>  an <A HREF = "#indx"><STRONG>events index</STRONG></A> 
              which stores gridded information about the number of
              cloud events, their starting dates and times, durations, 
              and associated event numbers; and
        <LI>  an <A HREF = "#list"><STRONG>events list</STRONG></A> 
              which stores the layered metorology information 
              associated with each cloud event.
    </UL>

    <H3> <A NAME = "hdr"> I/O API and File Headers</A> </H3>

    File headers match the usual I/O API file header structure, and can
    be read using the OPEN3() and DESC3() I/O API calls.  In this header
    structure, we make the following interpretations:<P> 
    <UL>
        <LI>  <STRONG>File type FTYPE3D</STRONG> is CLDFIL3 = -3, to 
              designate cloud files.<P> 

        <LI>  <STRONG>Variable names VNAME3D( 1...NVARS3D ) </STRONG>
              list the names of the meteorology variable profiles
              associated with each cloud-event.<P> 
    
        <LI>  <STRONG>Dimension NTHIK3D</STRONG> is mapped into the 
              maximum number of cloud events per cell.

        <LI>  <STRONG>Dimension NLAYS3D</STRONG> is mapped into the 
              layer-dimension for the cloud-event profiles being
              stored.

        <LI>  <STRONG>Attribute MXREC3D</STRONG> is the total number
              of cloud events stored in the file.
    </UL>

    
    <H3> <A NAME = "indx"> Events Index</A> </H3>

    The events index component of KF-Cloud files has the following
    arrays:
    <UL>
        <LI>  INTEGER  KFCOUNT( NCOLS3D, NROWS3D )
        <LI>  INTEGER  KFEVENT( NTHIK3D, NCOLS3D, NROWS3D )
        <LI>  INTEGER  KFSDATE( NTHIK3D, NCOLS3D, NROWS3D )
        <LI>  INTEGER  KFSTIME( NTHIK3D, NCOLS3D, NROWS3D )
        <LI>  INTEGER  KFLNGTH( NTHIK3D, NCOLS3D, NROWS3D )
    </UL>
    

    <H3> <A NAME = "list">Events List</A> </H3>

    Each cloud event corresponds to a record (numbered 1...MXREC3D),
    and stores the following information:
    <UL>
        <LI>  Event column and row (with respect to the file's
              horizontal grid); 
        <LI>  Event starting date, starting time, and duration, stored
              according to Models-3 conventions;
        <LI>  for each variable (1...NVARS3D) the vertical profile
              &lt;name&gt;( NLAYS3D ) 
    </UL>
    <P>


<H2> <A NAME = "tsries"> <STRONG>TSRIES3</STRONG> </A> = 7:  
     Hydrology Time Series </H2>

    A hydrology time series file behaves much like a degenerate gridded
    file, except that the numbers of rows and columns are usually 1,
    and that there are additional file attributes found in 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#atdsc">include file ATDSC3.EXT</A>.
    In the conventional interpretation, each variable represents
    one link in a stream network, and the additional attributes
    give the geospatial attributes of that link.
    <P>


<H2> <A NAME = "ptrfly"> <STRONG>PTRFLY3</STRONG> </A> = 8:
     Pointer-Flyer Observations</H2>

    A pointer-flyer observation file behaves much like a degenerate
    gridded file with NCOLS3D and NROWS3D set to 1, and certain mandatory 
    variables and variable-naming conventions to be used by analysis and
    visualization software.  Variables <STRONG>AIR_LAT</STRONG>, 
    <STRONG>AIR_LON</STRONG>, and <STRONG>AIR_ELV</STRONG> are
    mandatory, and represent the latitude, longitude, and elevation
    above mean sea level of the observation (in degrees and meters,
    respectively).  Variables with names <STRONG>AIR_*</STRONG>
    represent observational variables, and variables with names
    <STRONG>M3_*</STRONG> represent corresponding modeled variables.
    <P> 
    
    For pointer-flyer files, the 
    <STRONG><A HREF = "GRIDS.html#horiz">grid description 
    parameters</A></STRONG> give the &quot;clipping window&quot; or 
    &quot;bounding box&quot; to be used for map selection and 
    visualization, according to the following scheme:
    <UL>
        <LI>  <STRONG>(X_ORIG,Y_ORIG)</STRONG> are the lower-left corner
              in map coordinates for the bounding box.  If the file's 
              coordinate system is Lat-Lon (as should usually be the 
              case), these are specified in degrees; otherwise, they 
              represent meters.
        <LI>  <STRONG>(X_CELL,Y_CELL)</STRONG> specify the extent of the
              bounding box, also in units appropriate for the file's
              coordinate system.  (i.e.,
              (X_ORIG+_XCELL,Y_ORIG+Y_CELL) should be the upper right
              corner of the bounding box.
    </UL>
