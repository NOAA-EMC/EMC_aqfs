    INTEGER FUNCTION  INIT3()
</PRE><P> 

<H2> C version: </H2>  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    init3c() is a C wrapper calling the Fortran INIT3()

<H2> Summary: </H2>

    <CODE>#include &quot;iodecl3.h&quot;</CODE> for C.
    <P> 

    <VAR>INIT3()</VAR> initializes the I/O&nbsp;API's internal data
    structures and returns the unit number for the 
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html">log device </A> (opening the file
    with <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> 
    <CODE>&quot;LOGDEV&quot;</CODE>  on that unit, if the logical name
    has been set, otherwise  returning unit 6 for &quot;standard
    Fortran output&quot;.
    <P> 

    May be called multiple times; in which case, calls after the
    first simply return the unit number for the log file.
    <P> 

    User may optionally supply a  <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> 
    &quot;scenario description file&quot;  </A> with  up to 60 lines 
    of up to 80 characters each, by setenv'ing the logical name 
    SCENFILE to the physical file name of the a user-supplied 
    text file containing  the scenario description.   Contents of 
    the scenario description file will be copied into the headers 
    of all files opened for writing by the calling program.
    <P> 

    User may optionally supply a file name for the working 
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> log file </A>  by setenv'ing 
    the logical name LOGFILE to the path name.
    <P> 

    User may optionally supply an <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> 
    &quot;execution ID&quot; </A>  character-string
    of up to 80 characters by setenv'ing the logical name 
    EXECUTION_ID to it.  Contents of the execution ID will be
    copied into the headers of all files opened for writing by 
    the calling program.


<H2> Preconditions: </H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#iodecl"> 
    <CODE>INCLUDE 'IODECL3.EXT'</CODE> </A> 
    for Fortran, or 
    <CODE>#include &quot;iodecl3.h&quot;</CODE> for C.
    <P> 

    Repeated INIT3()-<A HREF = "SHUT3.html"> SHUT3() </A> sequences 
    within one program's execution may cause strange results.
    (Calls of INIT3() subsequent to SHUT3() will generate a warning
    message to the log).
