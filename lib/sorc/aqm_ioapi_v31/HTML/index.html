<HR> <!----------------------------------------------------------------->

    The Models-3/EDSS Input/Output Applications Programming Interface 
    (I/O&nbsp;API) provides the environmental model developer with an 
    easy-to-learn, easy-to-use <STRONG>programming library for data
    storage and access</STRONG>, available from both Fortran and C.  The
    same routines can be used for both file storage (using netCDF files)
    and model coupling (using PVM mailboxes). It is the standard data
    access library for both the NCSC/CMAS's EDSS project and EPA's
    Models-3. There is a external-package wrapper for the I/O&nbsp;API
    in the <A HREF = "http://wrf-model.org/index.php">Weather Research
    and Forecasting Model [WRF]</A>, which optionally uses I/O&nbsp;API 
    coupling mode to couple WRF-Chem with SMOKE.
    <P> 

    The I/O&nbsp;API provides a variety of data structure types for 
    organizing the data, and a set of access routines which offer
    selective direct access to the data in terms meaningful to the 
    modeler. For example,
         <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
         Read layer 1 of variable 'OZONE' from 'CONCFILE' for 
         5:00&nbsp;PM GMT on July&nbsp;19, 1988 and put the result 
         into array&nbsp;A.
         </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    is a direct English translation of a typical I/O&nbsp;API READ3() call.
    "Selective direct access" means that this READ3 call retrieves exactly
    this ozone data immediately.  It does not have to read through previous 
    hours of data, nor whatever other variables (such as NOX or PAN) are 
    in the file.  Data can be read or written in any order (or not at all).
    This characteristic provides the following advantages:
    <UL>  
        <LI> <STRONG>performance:</STRONG> visualization and analysis 
             programs looking at  selected parts of the data don't need
             to read unrequested data from the files.

        <LI> <STRONG>modularity:</STRONG>  Data can be read or written 
             in any order (or not at all).  The same input files serve
             both MAQSIP engineering models and full-chemistry 
             models -- the former reading just a few of the variables 
             from the files, the latter reading most of them. 
             The modular-model structure used for MAQSIP and Models-3 
             depends upon this.

        <LI> <STRONG>robustness:</STRONG>  data are "tagged" by name, 
             date, and time; miscounted record-numbers don't scramble
             temperatures with pressures, for example.
    </UL>

    I/O&nbsp;API files also have the following characteristics 
    <UL>  
        <LI>  They are <STRONG>machine-independent</STRONG> and 
              network-transparent, except for the NCEP native-binary
              mode.  Files created on a Cray can be read on a desktop
              workstation (or vice versa) either via NFS mounting or
              FTP, with no further translation necessary.

        <LI>  They are <STRONG>self-describing</STRONG> -- that is, they 
              contain headers which provide a complete set of information
              necessary to use and interpret the data they contain. 

        <LI>  The API provides automated  built-in mechanisms to support 
              <STRONG>production application requirements </STRONG>for 
              histories and audit trails:
              <UL>  
                  <LI> ID of the program execution which produced the
                       file
                  <LI> Description of the study scenario in which 
                       the file was generated
              </UL>

        <LI>  They support a <STRONG>variety of data types</STRONG> used in 
              the environmental sciences, among them
              <UL>  
                  <LI>  <VAR>gridded</VAR> (e.g., concentration fields or 
                        meteorology-model temperatures)

                  <LI>  <VAR>grid-boundary</VAR> (for air quality model 
                        boundary conditions)

                  <LI>  <VAR>scattered</VAR> (e.g., meteorology 
                        observations or source level emissions)

                  <LI>  <VAR>sparse matrix</VAR> (as used in the 
                        <A HREF = "../emissions/index.html">SMOKE</A> 
                        emissions model)

              </UL>

        <LI>  They support three different <STRONG>time step
              structures:</STRONG>
              <UL>  
                  <LI>  <VAR>time-stepped</VAR> (with regular time-steps) like
                        hourly model-output concentration fields or
                        twice-daily upper air meteorology observation
                        profiles, or
                  <LI>  <VAR>time-independent</VAR> like terrain height.
                  <LI>  <VAR>restart,</VAR> which maintains
                        &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot;
                        time step records, so that restart data
                        does not consume an inordinate amount of
                        disk space
              </UL>
    </UL>
    <P> 

    The I/O&nbsp;API also contains an extensive set of utility routines 
    for manipulating dates and times, performing coordinate conversions, 
    storing and recalling grid definitions, sparse matrix arithmetic,
    etc., as well as a set of data-manipulation and statistical analysis
    programs.  It has an extensive documentation set, including 
    <UL>  
        <LI>  <A HREF = "TUTORIAL.html">tutorial</A>; 
        <LI>  <A HREF = "REQUIREMENTS.html">requirements document</A>; 
        <LI>  <A HREF = "AA.html">indexes and user manuals</A>
              for data access routines, utility routines, date/time
              manipulation routines, and analysis programs; 
        <LI>  <A HREF = "AA.html#tools">Data-manipulation,
              geospatial-transform, and statistical-analysis
              programs</A>
        <LI>  <A HREF = "SAMPLE.html">several sample programs</A>
    </UL>
    <P> 
    
    Various <A HREF = "NEWSTUFF.html">extensions and research
    efforts</A>  to the I/O&nbsp;API have been developed or are under
    development. Developments include the use of the I/O&nbsp;API
    interacting with PVM for model coupling, and adding operations to
    read or write entire time series (with multiple time steps) as
    single operations, and research projects include data-parallel I/O
    and a very powerful &quot;geospatial cell complex&quot; data type
    with polygonal-cell decompositions that may be both time
    independent (as for finite elememt modeling) and time dependent (as
    for moving-mesh plume-in-grid modeling).
