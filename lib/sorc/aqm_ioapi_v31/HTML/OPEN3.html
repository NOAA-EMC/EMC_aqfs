<H1>    OPEN3()  and  open3c() </H1>

<H2> Fortran version: </H2>
<PRE>
    LOGICAL FUNCTION  OPEN3( FNAME, FSTATUS, PGNAME )
        CHARACTER*(*)   FNAME   !  file name for query
        INTEGER         FSTATUS !  FSREAD3, FSRDWR3, FSNEW3, FSUNKN3, FSCREA3
        CHARACTER*(*)   PGNAME  !  name of calling program
</PRE><P> 

<H2> C version: </H2>  open3c() is a C wrapper calling the Fortran OPEN3()
<PRE>
    int open3c( const char          * fname ,
                const IOAPI_Bdesc3  * bdesc ,
                const IOAPI_Cdesc3  * cdesc ,
                int                   fstatus ,
                const char          * pgname ) ;
</PRE><P> 

<H2> See Also:</H2> 
    <A HREF = "PROMPTMFILE.html">PROMPTMFILE()</A>,
    which is a (text-mode interactive) wrapper around OPEN3() that
    prompts the user for the logical name of the file to be opened.
    <P> 
    Also see <A HREF = "GETDFILE.html">GETDFILE()</A> and
    <A HREF = "GETEFILE.html">GETEFILE()</A>, for opening
    Fortran sequential and direct access files by logical name.
    <P> 

<H2> Summary: </H2>
    Open or create Models-3 file with <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> 
    logical name </A> FNAME, with  file mode/status FSTATUS of one of 
    the following 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#magic"> &quot;magic number&quot; tokens </A> 
    (defined in INCLUDE-file 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms">  PARMS3.EXT </A>):
<PRE>
    FSREAD3==1 for read-only,
    FSRDWR3==2 for read/write/update of existing files,
    FSNEW3 ==3 for read/write of new files,
    FSUNKN3==4 for read/write/update of unknown (new vs. old)
               files.  If file does not exist, create it; 
               else check for consistency with user-supplied
               file description
    FSCREA3==5 for create/truncate/read/write of files.
               If file exists, delete it; then create a new
               (empty) file according to the user-supplied
               file description
</PRE><P> 

    If FNAME is being opened for write, copies 
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> scenario description </A>
    from file with logical name SCENDESC, name PGNAME of the 
    caller, and value of 
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> environment variable </A>
    EXECUTION_ID to 
    the file's history (maintained in the file header).
    <P> 
    
    If file may possibly be created (i.e., if the access mode is
    either FSNEW3, FSUNKN3, or FSCREA3), the user must supply a file
    description in the COMMONs in INCLUDE-file 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A> (for
    Fortran) or in the data structures pointed to by arguments
    bdesc and cdesc (for C).  In the latter case, the file
    description struct pointers are only required when the file is
    being opened &quot;new&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot;.
    <P> 

    <STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG> Joan Novak (EPA)  and Ed Bilicki (MCNC) 
    have declared as a software standard that <STRONG>modeling programs
    may not  use FSCREA3 as the mode for opening files.</STRONG>  
    FSCREA3 is reserved for use by analysis/data extraction programs
    only.
    <P>

    May be called multiple times for a file (provided you don't
    attempt to go from readonly to any read/write status).

<H2> Preconditions: </H2>
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#iodecl"> 
    <CODE>INCLUDE 'IODECL3.EXT'</CODE> </A> 
    and 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> 
    <CODE>INCLUDE 'FDESC3.EXT'</CODE> </A> 
    for Fortran, or 
    <CODE>#include &quot;iodecl3.h&quot;</CODE> and 
    <CODE>#include &quot;fdesc3.h&quot;</CODE> for C.
    <P> 

    FNAME must have length at most 16.
    <P> 
    
    For FSREAD3 or FSRDWR3, file must already exist.
    <P> 
    
    For FSNEW3, file must <EM>not</EM> already exist.
    <P> 
    
    For FSNEW3, FSUNKN3, or FSCREA3, caller must supply file description
    (which must follow Models-3 <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> 
    date and time conventions </A>).
    <P> 
    
    I/O API must already be initialized by a call to 
    <A HREF = "INIT3.html"> INIT3() or init3c(). </A>
    <P> 
    
    OPEN3() must not be called for read/write/update (FSRDWR3, FSNEW3,
    FSUNK3, or FSCREA3) on a file already open for read-only (FSREAD3).
    <P>

    OPEN3() must not be called for new (FSNEW3) on a file already
    open.
    
<H2> Fortran Usage: </H2>

    For Fortran-90 declarations and interface checking:    
    <PRE>
    <A HREF = "M3UTILIO.html">USE M3UTILIO</A>
    </PRE><P>
 
    (See <A HREF = "SAMPLE.html">sample</A> programs
    <A HREF = "LATLON.txt">LATLON</A> or
    <A HREF = "PRESZ.txt">PRESZ</A>
    for additional usage examples.)

<PRE>
    ...
    USE M3UTILIO
    ...
    IF ( OPEN3( 'MYFILE', FSREAD3, 'Myprogram' ) ) THEN
C              MYFILE successfully opened for read-only
        ...
    ELSE
C           Could not open MYFILE for read-only. See program log 
C           for further info.
        ...
    END IF
    ...
C       &lt;Fill in the file's description to variables in FDESC3.EXT&amp;gt;
    SDATE3D = 1988021
    ...
    IF ( OPEN3( 'AFILE', FSNEW3, 'Myprogram' ) ) THEN
C              AFILE successfully opened as a new file
        ...
    ELSE
C           Could not open AFILE as a new file:  probably AFILE already
C           exists.  See program log for further info.
        ...
    END IF
    ...

    IF ( OPEN3( 'BFILE', FSUNKN3, 'Myprogram' ) ) THEN
C              BFILE successfully opened as unknown
        ...
    ELSE
C           Could not open BFILE as unknown:  probably BFILE already
C           exists and has a different description than you gave.
C           See program log for further info.
        ...
