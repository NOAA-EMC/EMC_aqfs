<H1>    Program M4FILTER </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile&gt;     &lt;path name&gt;
    m4filter
</PRE>
where <VAR>infile</VAR> is the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> 
of the input file.  
<P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

The program <VAR>m4filter</VAR> can be used to convert files from
the previous version of the I/O API to the new version.  It has a
in it both a copy of the old version and a new version (&quot;m4io&quot;)
with the names of the routines changed so that the linker doesn't
get confused.  To run it, you need to have assigned 
<A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> to the physical 
file names of both the input and output files, according to 
<A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> Models-3 conventions. </A>  You
will be prompted for those attributes of the new (output) file
which are not found in the header of the input file.  All of these
attributes have to do either with the 
<A HREF = "GRIDS.html#horiz"> horizontal  </A> or the 
<A HREF = "GRIDS.html#vert"> vertical </A> grid and
coordinate system description.  They are the following:
    
<DL>
     <DT> <STRONG>P_ALPHA</STRONG>  First horizontal coordinate
          system (map projection) descriptive angle parameter
     <DT> <STRONG>P_BETA</STRONG>  Second horizontal coordinate
          system (map projection) descriptive angle parameter
     <DT> <STRONG>P_GAMMA</STRONG>  Third horizontal coordinate
          system (map projection) descriptive angle parameter
     <DT> <STRONG>XCENT</STRONG>  Longitude for the origin of the
          Cartesian (X-Y) coordinate system (except for UTM, where
          it is the standard-UTM location for the origin of
          offset-UTM coordinate systems (in meters)).
     <DT> <STRONG>YCENT</STRONG>  Latitude (or UTM) for the origin 
          of the Cartesian (X-Y) coordinate system (At latitude YCENT,
          longitude XCENT (or standard-UTM coordinates (XCENT,YCENT)), 
          the Cartesian (X,Y) is (0,0).
     <DT> <STRONG>VGTYPE</STRONG>  Vertical coordinate system type
     <DT> <STRONG>VGTOP</STRONG>  Top of the model
          (sigma-coordinates only)
     <DT> <STRONG>VGLVS(0:NLAYS)</STRONG>  Array of level values
          defining the full-levels.
</DL>
<P> 

<STRONG>Versions of the program</STRONG> are available for each 
<A HREF = "LIBS.html"> supported architecture </A>
(workstation versions are currently in the directories 
<VAR>/env/apps/(SunOS5 | IRIX5 | alphaOSF1)/bin</VAR>; Cray versions
are in <VAR>/work/xcc/m3tools</VAR> on <VAR>sequoia</VAR>) and
<VAR>/flyer/com/epa/coats/bin</VAR> or
<VAR>/usr/local/edss/framework/EDSSv0.3pre/unicos9_TS/bin/OPTIMIZE</VAR>
on <VAR>flyer</VAR>.
<P> 

<STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> you need to assign a 
<A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> to the physical file
name of the input file, according to Models-3 conventions, using 
the operation 
<PRE>
    &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
</PRE>
<STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical name you
have chosen for the input file, and then extensively for the options 
to choose; the prompts will have default responses which can be 
accepted by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.
<P> 

Note that the set of conversions which can be performed by one 
execution of M4FILTER is quite complex, being dependent upon the 
type of file being converted.  If you want to run this program in 
<STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> (i.e., from a script), the recommended 
way to develop the script is to run the program once interactively 
while noting your pattern of responses to the prompts.  The pattern 
of responses then becomes either a command-input file which is 
redirected into the program's execution by the script, or becomes 
a &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution.
<P>
