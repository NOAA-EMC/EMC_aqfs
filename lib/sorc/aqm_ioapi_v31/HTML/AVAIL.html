    GNU  <VAR>gfortran</VAR> seems to be insistent upon incompatibility:
    not only incompatibility with existing industry standards, but even
    inconsistency with itself.  In some cases, not even <CODE>Makefile</CODE>
    will continue to work from one version to the next.  At this time,
    <VAR>gfortran</VAR> should be used only with trepidation.

	<DT><STRONG>Finding <CODE>MODULE</CODE> files</STRONG>
	<DD>
	Fortran compilers use various ways to find directories 
	containing &quot;module files&quot; such as the I/O&nbsp;API's
	<VAR>m3utilio.mod</VAR>.
	Suppose the I/O API's <CODE>OBJDIR</CODE> is something like
	<VAR>/foo/bar/$BIN</VAR>.  Then for most F90 compilers, the way
	to tell the compiler to search that directory for module files
	is to use the following as a compiler-flag:
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	-I/foo/bar/$BIN
	</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>.
	Some other compilers (e.g., Sun, Absoft, older versions of
	<VAR>gfortran</VAR>) use
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	-M/foo/bar/$BIN
	</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>.
	Recent versions of <VAR>gfortran</VAR> use 
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	-J/foo/bar/$BIN
	</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>.
	Needless to say, this makes it more difficult to write <VAR>Makefile</VAR>s ;-(
	<P>

	<DT><STRONG><CODE>IARGC</CODE> and
	<CODE>COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT</CODE>,
	etc.</STRONG>
	<DD>
	Recent versions of <VAR>gfortran</VAR> break compatibility with 
	older versions, and with standards such as Mil-Spec 1753, in their
	handling of command line arguments:  they no longer support 
	<CODE>IARGC()</CODE> and <CODE>GETARG()</CODE>, insisting rather
	on Fortran-2003 constructs <CODE>COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT()</CODE> and
	<CODE>GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT()</CODE>.
	<P>

	I/O&nbsp;API file <VAR>init3.F</VAR> now has &quot;hacks&quot; to
	get around this incompatibility:  if preprocessor-symbol
	<CODE>NEED_ARGS</CODE> is defined, it generates
	<CODE>IARGC()</CODE> and <CODE>GETARG()</CODE> in terms of
	<CODE>COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT()</CODE> and
	<CODE>GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT()</CODE>. By default,
	<VAR>Makeinclude.Linux2_x86</VAR>, and 
	<VAR>Makeinclude.Linux2_x86_64</VAR> and 
	<VAR>Makeinclude.Linux2_x86_64gfort</VAR> (which specify how to
	build the I/O&nbsp;API (etc.) for 32-bit or 64-bit
	<VAR>gfortran/gcc</VAR>) now define this symbol as part of
	<VAR>make</VAR>-variable <CODE>ARCHFLAGS</CODE>.
	<P>

	If you get &quot;symbol not found&quot; errors when building 
	I/O&nbsp;API  programs like those in <VAR>m3tools</VAR>,  
	remove this  <CODE> -DNEED_ARGS=1</CODE> from the relevant
	<VAR>Makeinclude</VAR> file.

    <H3><A NAME="ncf4">NOTE on  NetCDF Version&nbsp;4</A></H3>

    In general, you are best off if you can build the whole modeling
    system (<VAR>libnetcdf.a</VAR>, <VAR>libpvm3.a</VAR>,
    <VAR>libioapi.a</VAR>, and your model(s)  <VAR>CMAQ</VAR>,
    <VAR>SMOKE</VAR>, etc. with a common compiler set and common set of
    compile-flags.
    <P>
    
    NetCDF Version&nbsp;4.x have lots of additional build options,
    that will require a complex set of additional libraries in
    <VAR>Makefile</VAR>s <STRONG>and all other model-building systems</STRONG>.
    It is recommended that you disable these options by adding the
    command-line flags below to your netCDF <VAR>configure</VAR>
    command:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    --disable-netcdf4 --disable-dap
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    NetCDF Version&nbsp;4.1 and later also split the Fortran
    interfaces into a separate library <VAR>libnetcdff.a</VAR>
    As a result, much compatiblity with the infrastructure
    (<VAR>Makefile</VAR>s, etc.) is broken: you <STRONG>must modify 
    all <VAR>Makefile</VAR>s, replacing <CODE>-lnetcdf</CODE> with
    <CODE>-lnetcdff&nbsp;-lnetcdf</CODE></STRONG>.  If you don't
    build netCDF as indicated above, you will need additional libraries
    that may be discovered by running the netCDF command
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <VAR>nc-config --libs</VAR>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P> 

    <STRONG>
    Starting with I/O&nbsp;API Version&nbsp;3.1 of October&nbsp;11,
    2011, the <VAR>m3tools/Makefile</VAR>s are configured to use the
    <CODE>-lnetcdff&nbsp;-lnetcdf</CODE> netCDF-v4-style libraries.  If
    using a previous version of netCDF, you must modify them manually.
    <P>
    You must also modify the build-systems for CMAQ. MCIP, SMOKE, and
    all your other models similarly.

              Any changes are likely to result in very obscure,
              difficult-to-diagnose bugs caused by an inconsistency
              between standard <VAR>libioapi.a</VAR> object-libraries
              and whatever code is compiled with the resulting modified
              <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>-file. Note  that the distribution
              license specifies that by making any changes to any of
              these <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> files, the user explicitly
              agrees that <STRONG>in the case any assistance is 
              required of BAMS or of the I/O&nbsp;API author,
              Carlie&nbsp;J. Coats,&nbsp;Jr. as a result of such
              changes, the user and/or his project or contract agrees to
              reimburse BAMS and/or the I/O&nbsp;API author,
              Carlie&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Coats,&nbsp;Jr., at a rate triple the

        <DD>  On at least Sun Solaris and SGI IRIX platforms, <VAR>f77</VAR>
              and <VAR>f90</VAR> are known not to be link compatible; you will
              need to keep builds for them separate (which is the original 
              distinction for <CODE>BIN=IRIX64f77<CODE> vs <CODE>BIN=IRIX64f90<CODE>,
              for example).  It is recommended that for other systems you likewise
              keep different compiler systems (and sometimes even different
              versions of the same compiler--Intel <VAR>ifort</VAR> versions 
              10, 11, and 12, for example) separate.

    Version&nbsp;3.0 of the I/O&nbsp;API

    portability and OpenMP thread-safety.

    This release is current as of June&nbsp;11, 2007 and includes all
    bug-fixes up through that date.  <STRONG>It should be considered
    the production release of Version&nbsp;3.0 for netCDF files and for
    PVM-based virtual files</STRONG>, but should probably still be
    considered &quot;beta&quot; for native-binary layer, and for the
    multi-file file-list layer, since each of these latter has
    basically a single-user community rather than widespread beta-test
    usage.

    The build procedure also has been considerably enhanced, by the addition
    of a top-level  <VAR>Makefile</VAR> which allows one to build
    various configurations of the entire (<VAR>I/O&nbsp;API +
    <CODE>M3TOOLS</CODE></VAR>) system with one <VAR>make</VAR> command. 
    Depending upon what you want to do, there are two main options for
    how you will build the system:
    <DL>
        <DT>  <STRONG>To build multiple configurations</STRONG> from
              one installation directory (e.g., multiple compilers,
              etc.)
        <DD>  The procedure is much as before, except that one can
              use just a single <VAR>make&nbsp;bins</VAR> command to build all
              the libraries and all the executables for a configuration.
              <P>
              Before you do so, yhou should edit the <VAR>ioapi/Makefile</VAR>
              and  <VAR>m3tools/Makefile</VAR> commands so that the
              <VAR>make&nbsp;bins</VAR> and <VAR>make&nbsp;binclean</VAR> 
              commands properly reflect the configurations you want to build.
              <P>
        <P>
        <DT>  <STRONG>To build a single configuration</STRONG> from

    used by your programs.  Failure to do so may result in link-failures

    Binary executables and object libraries are no longer available 
    (June 11, 2012 ).
    <P>
    <STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG> On the Sun SunOS and SGI IRIX platforms,
    there are  <STRONG><EM>link incompatibilities between f77 and
    f90</EM></STRONG>, caused by the fact that these vendors'
    <EM>f77</EM> and <EM>f90</EM> by default use different system
    libraries.  Compaq, Cray, and IBM compilers do not seem to do this;
    however, it is probably advisable not to mix  <EM>f77</EM> and
    <EM>f90</EM> compiles on a not-well-understood new platform.
