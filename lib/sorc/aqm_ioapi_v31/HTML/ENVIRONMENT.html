<H1>    Environment Variables for the I/O API </H1>

Generally, all OpenMP parallel programs use environment variable
<STRONG>OMP_NUM_THREADS</STRONG> to control how many parallel
threads/processors are used for program execution.  In particular,
this applies to &quot;m3tools&quot; programs <CODE>M3AGMASK, M3AGMAX,
M3COMBO, M3TPROC</CODE> and <CODE>VERINTEGRAL</CODE> for I/O&nbsp;API
version&nbsp;3.1 later than Nov.&nbsp;21, 2013.
<P>
    
The following are standard environment variables supported or used
by the I/O API.  These should be set using <VAR>setenv</VAR>, 
for example, if you are using <VAR>csh</VAR>).
<UL>
    <LI>  <STRONG>LOGFILE</STRONG>  is the physical pathname for 
          the program log.   If this logical name is present, the 
          indicated file  is opened  for output; otherwise, Fortran 
          standard output to UNIT 6 for the log is assumed.  This log
          file is used throughout the I/O API, also, its unit
          number is returned by <A HREF = "INIT3.html"> INIT3() </A>.
          <P>
    
    <LI>  <STRONG>SCENFILE</STRONG> is the physical pathname for the 
          scenario description file.  The contents of this file will be 
          copied into the &quot;update description&quot; of files 
          opened for writing during this program execution.  The file 
          may have up to <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms">
          <CODE>MXDESC3=60</CODE></A> lines of length at most
          <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"> <CODE>MXDLIN3=80.</CODE> </A>
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>EXECUTION_ID</STRONG> is provided for use in 
          tracking the system ID of the current execution, and is 
          copied into the &quot;execution ID&quot; field of files 
          opened for writing during this program execution.  
          It is a character string of length at most 
          <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"> <CODE>MXDLIN3=80.</CODE> </A>
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_CHECK_HEADERS</STRONG> controls whether
          consistency and validity checks are turned on for files
          being created (value begins with 'Y' or 'y'), or not.
          The default value is 'N', indicating that the check will not
          take place.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_LOG_WRITE</STRONG> controls whether
          a log message is written for each successful WRITE3()
          operation (messages are always written for failures).
          The default value is 'Y', indicating that the log messages
          will be generated.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_KEEP_NSTEPS</STRONG> controls how 
          many time steps of data will be kept in active PVM
          mailboxes for <A HREF="BUFFERED.html#pvm">I/O&nbsp;API
          coupling-mode virtual files</A>, with a default value of 2.
          <P>

</UL>             

The following environment variable is used by grid-description and
grid manipulation utility routines such as DSCGRID() and DSCOORD().
<UL>
    <LI>  <STRONG>GRIDDESC</STRONG> is the logical name for the ASCII
          <A HREF = "GRIDS.html#horiz"> coordinate and grid 
          description </A> files used by utility  routines 
          <A HREF = "DSCGRID.html"> DSCGRID() and DSCOORD(). </A>
</UL>             
<P> 

The following environment variable controls whether 
routines <A HREF = "GETDBLE.html">GETDBLE()</A>, 
<A HREF = "GETMENU.html">GETMENU()</A>,
<A HREF = "GETNUM.html">GETNUM()</A>,
<A HREF = "GETREAL.html">GETREAL()</A>,
<A HREF = "GETSTR.html">GETSTR()</A>,
<A HREF = "GETYN.html">GETYN()</A>,
<A HREF = "PROMPTFFILE.html">PROMPTFFILE()</A>, and
<A HREF = "PROMPTMFILE.html">PROMPTMFILE()</A>, prompt the user for
the value requested, or not.  Setting PROMPTFLAG to &quot;N&quot;
can be used, in conjunction with the selection of &quot;smart&quot;
defaults within programs, to make it easier to write scripts for
running various programs.
<UL>
    <LI>  <STRONG>PROMPTFLAG</STRONG> 
</UL>
<P>         


Routines <A HREF = "ENVDBLE.html">ENVDBLE</A> , 
<A HREF = "ENVINT.html">ENVINT</A> , 
<A HREF = "ENVREAL.html">ENVREAL</A> , 
<A HREF = "ENVSTR.html">ENVSTR</A> , and 
<A HREF = "ENVYN.html">ENVYN</A> can be used from programs
to find the values of environment values of types DOUBLE PRECISION,
INTEGER, REAL, CHARACTER STRING, and LOGICAL, respectively, log the 
value retrieved, convert it to the indicated type, and return it to 
the caller.  Routine <A HREF = "NAMEVAL.html">NAMEVAL</A>, which 
performs a similar function for CHARACTER STRINGs, but does not log 
the transaction, is used internally by the I/O API.  Routine
<A HREF = "SETENV.html">SETENV</A> can be used to set environment
variables for the currently-executing program.
