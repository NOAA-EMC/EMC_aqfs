* Blank lines and asterisk in column 1 are comment lines.
* Tables are free format, space delimited.
* Most names are case sensitive.
*
* General rules for paths and path templates:
*
* Paths may begin with an environment variable, e.g. $DATA/...
* Both relative and absolute paths are supported.
* Template codes YYYY, MM, DD, and HH will be replaced with date
*   and time strings within the usage context.
* Multiple substitutions within each template are supported.
*
*--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*-------------------------------------------------
* Input and output file settings.
*-------------------------------------------------

* File templates.

obs file template           = data/bcdata.YYYYMM/airnow/YYYY/YYYYMMDD/b008/xx021
interp file template        = data/bcdata.YYYYMM/interpolated/ozone/YYYY/forecasts.interp.YYYYMMDD.HHz.nc
gridded input file template = data/bcdata.YYYYMM/grid/YYYYMMDD/aqm.tHHz.O3_pm25.ncf
output file template        = out/ozone.corrected.YYYYMMDD.HHz.nc
new site list template      = sites/sites.valid.ozone.YYYYMMDD.HHz.list

* Grid coordinate file.

grid coordinate file        = data/coords/aqm.t12z.grdcro2d.ncf

* Predictor weights file.
* "equal weights" for no file, all equal weights, all sites.

* The SUBSET keyword, if included, will be replaced with first
* and last weight set index numbers (subset ID's) from weight
* generation.
*
* The SUBSET keyword will be OMITTED from the weight file name
* when subsetting is not selected in weight generation.  The
* SUBSET keyword will also be omitted in normal bias correction
* mode.
*
* This behavior allows the same weight file name template to be
* shared between normal and weight generation modes.
*
* For correct operation, the SUBSET keyword must be preceeded
* and followed by single period characters.

predictor weights file      = equal weights

* Site exception list for bias thresholds.
* "none" to disable.

*site exception file         = bias_thresholds.ozone.yyyy.mmdd.txt
site exception file         = none

*-------------------------------------------------
* Select analog variables.
*-------------------------------------------------

* Target variable for bias correction.
* Different var names within obs and model input data sets.

* Note, obs and model target vars must be the same quantity
* for valid bias correction.  User is responsible.

target obs variable         = COPO
target model variable       = O3

* Analog variable table; each variable to be included in current analysis.

* Table begins with a line of dashes that must not be commented.
* Table ends with a blank line or end of file.
* Var names are the model var names in interpolated files, NOT obs var names.
* Optional C suffix means limits are in Centigrade; for temperature only.
* Circular is Y or N to indicate 0-360 circular variables, e.g. wind direction.

* Reference for these current model var names are CMAQ and MET
* gridded model output archives provided by Pius Lee of NOAA/ARL.

*-------------------------------------------------
* Input filter controls.
*-------------------------------------------------

* Obs data blackout interval, to suppress all obs within problematic
* time interval, such as Fourth of July.
*
* Each date/time format is MM DD HHz.  Leading zeros not required.
* Date and time are referenced to original labeling of the obs data.
* Leave blank for no blackout interval.
*
* Interval is inclusive.  Both start and end dates/times are blacked out,
* along with all intervening times.
*
* Blackout applies to the same dates in every calendar year within
* the input obs data.

obs blackout start date     = 7 4 12z
obs blackout end date       = 7 6 11z

*-------------------------------------------------
* Analog filter controls.
*-------------------------------------------------

* Select filter method.  See main_analog.f90.
* Note, AnEnMean MUST be selected for weight generation.

*filter method               = AnEnMean
filter method               = KFAN

number of analogs           = 10

*Use for PM 2.5 (01-19-2018)
*bias formula = mean (forecast plus model predictions) plus bias
*Use for Ozone (01-19-2018)
bias formula = forecast plus bias

*-------------------------------------------------
* Post processing controls.
*-------------------------------------------------

* See spreading.f90.

*output limit method         = hard zero
output limit method         = revert to fraction of uncorrected
*output limit method         = none

*-------------------------------------------------
* Weight generation controls.
*-------------------------------------------------

* See weight_control.f90.

* Note, actual weight generation is enabled on bias_correct command line.

* Weight generation controls are used only in weight generation mode.

* Number of weight increments to distribute across all weight combinations.
* E.g. 10 = increments of 0.1
* Note, each complete weight combination will sum to 1.0 (normalized).

number of weight increments              = 10

* First day number to calculate test forecasts for weight generation.
* Relative to day 1 = start of full training period.

forecast start day for weight generation = 31

* Last forecast hour to calculate test forecasts for weight generation.

last forecast hour for weight generation = 48

*-------------------------------------------------
* Debug and diagnostic settings.
*-------------------------------------------------

* Note, "diag" verbosity control is on the main command line.

* Template for test site output files.
* SSS = site index number.
* "none" to disable.

*site file template          = ozone/sites/bias.HHz.site-SSSS.txt
site file template          = none

* Template for filter intermediate test output file.
* DDDD = day serial number.
* "none" to disable.

*filter array file template  = ozone/bias.HHz.DDDD.txt
filter array file template  = none

* Stop after filter, before spreading.  For testing and evaluation only.

stop after filter           = no

* End of config file.
